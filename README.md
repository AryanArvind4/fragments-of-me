# ðŸŽ¨ Fragments of Me

**Fragments of Me** is an AI-powered art generation project that transforms emotions into visual art. Users describe how they're feeling, choose from five assistant styles, and receive AI-generated artwork using GPT-4 for prompt enhancement and Stable Diffusion for image generation.

## ðŸ§  How it Works

1. The user provides a short emotional reflection (e.g., dreams, feelings).
2. A style persona (e.g., *Dream Translator* or *Visual Storyteller*) is selected.
3. GPT-4 enhances the raw input into a symbolic, artistic prompt.
4. Stable Diffusion (via `diffusers`) generates the corresponding image.
5. Everything is served through a Gradio interface.
